      <h3>
        Students will be able to find internships that they actually qualify for
        instead of having to search other job listing sites like LinkedIn. What
        makes this site unique is it is like LinkedIn but for interns only. Not
        only will students be able to search for jobs, but they will be able to
        have resources about different careers and job tips, as well as other
        features like liking internship job descriptions and which will feed an
        AI algorithm to give the student similar jobs to the ones they have
        previously liked.

              Once we had thought of some of the features we wanted to include,
              we then thought of what pages should our site contain. We decided
              to do some more preliminary research at sites like Glassdoor,
              Indeed, and LinkedIn. We found that most of these sites had
              roughly the same pages such as a landing page, job descriptions,
              companies, and careers. With this research in mind, we chose these
              pages for our site: landing page, job page, career page, and saved
              page.

        <h3>
          In selecting the colors we wanted to use for this project, we first
          did some research. In our research, we found that companies like
          Glassdoor or Indeed had one primary color and used different shades of
          gray, white, and black in conjunction with the occasional pop of
          sub-color. Due to this common trend, we noticed this was something we
          wanted to include in our designs. We first decided to think back to
          our existing knowledge of color theory and remembered that purple
          often means independent or wise. We thought these were two
          characteristics we wanted to have in our site because if you are
          looking for an internship, you are becoming more independent and you
          are wise because you are in college and preparing for your career.
          Since these qualities fit perfectly for the direction we wanted to go
          in, we decided we wanted to have our main color be purple. Then we
          decided to look on the color wheel to decide which accent colors we
          wanted to incorporate. Since purple is a secondary color, we thought
          that if we used a different hue of some primary colors, this would
          help create contrast, so we decided to use blue and yellow.
