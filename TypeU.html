      <h3>
        Managing a child's diabetes is an overwhelming responsibility, particularly for parents navigating the early stages after diagnosis. The emotional and cognitive burden of making constant, informed medical decisions can lead to stress and uncertainty, impacting both caregivers and healthcare professionals. While the TypeU app, developed in collaboration with the Children's Hospital of Atlanta and the AppHatchery at Emory University, has provided educational resources for two years within this app, however, there remains a critical need for a more tailored decision support tool to guide parents in real-time.      <br>
        <br>
        This project aims to enhance the TypeU app by designing and integrating a decision support tool that empowers parents to make informed choices about their child's diabetes management. By conducting in-depth user research and refining the app's interface, we seek to reduce caregiver stress while alleviating the workload of healthcare professionals. The outcome will be user-tested features that improves confidence, ensures timely interventions, and strengthens the overall support system for families managing diabetes.

        <h3><b>Goal:</b></h3>
        <h3>
            Our goal is to design and integrate a decision support tool within the TypeU app that empowers parents to make informed, confident decisions about their child's diabetes care. By engaging with both caregivers and healthcare professionals, we aim to create an inclusive, user-centered solution that reduces stress, enhances trust in digital tools, and ensures timely, effective diabetes management while also alleviating the burden on healthcare providers.        </h3>
       
        <h3><b>Problem:</b></h3>
<h3>Parents and caregivers of newly diagnosed diabetic children face significant emotional and cognitive challenges in managing their child’s health. The complexity of diabetes care, combined with the lack of immediate support post-discharge, can lead to stress, uncertainty, and potential delays in critical decision-making. While digital tools like the TypeU app offer educational resources, many caregivers struggle to trust them over traditional healthcare guidance. Additionally, healthcare professionals experience increased workloads answering common questions that could be addressed through better digital support.
</h3>     
        <h3><b>Problem Statement:</b></h3>
        <h3>How might we design a decision support tool within the TypeU app that reduces the emotional and cognitive load for parents of newly diagnosed diabetic children, fosters trust in digital guidance, and ensures timely, informed decision-making—ultimately easing caregiver stress and minimizing healthcare delays?</h3>

    <table>
        <row>
            <td> <h3><b>Findings:</b> <br> <br>
                1. T1D decision-making involves a complex balance of monitoring blood glucose levels, managing insulin doses, considering diet and physical activity, and adapting to daily life changes. <br><br>
                2. In humanitarian settings, managing T1DM is further complicated by barriers to insulin access, safe storage, and food insecurity, making glucose management difficult. The care burden on families adds emotional and financial stress, while knowledge gaps and social stigma hinder effective disease management. <br><br>
                3. Managing T1D becomes more challenging from contracting illnesses like colds or flues; your body releases hormones that raise blood glucose levels, making it harder to stay within the target range. <br><br>
                4. Poor diabetes management during illness can escalate into serious conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), both of which require emergency hospital admission. <br><br>

         <h3>To dive deeper and ask follow-up questions of the users learn more about the challenges, process, and behavioral changes through their diagnosis journey. Additionally, this could provide an opportunity to identify individuals interested in participating in the diary study.</h3>

                A common mistake and "emergency" parents face is giving long-acting insulin instead of short-acting insulin, and vice versa.
            </li>
            <li>
                Parents frequently monitor their child's levels remotely using the Dexcom app.
            </li>
            <li>
                Children with diabetes often have to mature quickly and adjust to a new normal, which strains their mental health and that of their parents.
            </li>
            <li>
                Parents seek information from various sources and even Google things like carb counts, highlighting the lack of a centralized information hub.
            </li>
            <li>
                Obtaining insulin can be a barrier, often due to issues with the pharmacy or insurance.  
            </li>
            <li>
                Parents want their child to manage their diabetes independently.  
            </li>
            <li>
                Peer perception influences a child's willingness to use pumps, as they often don't want their friends to know they have diabetes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Parents are well-connected with their school nurse, who often has extra supplies on hand.

                Diabetes burnout is common from constant decision-making; frustration can hinder care without complete giving up.

            <li>Transportation, insurance issues, and other factors contribute to diabetes burnout</li>
            <li>
                Math can be challenging for calculating carb and insulin bolus.

            <li>
                There is a need to track long-term blood sugar levels.
            </li>
            <li>
                Moderate to large ketones are often the reason for emergency calls, where parents perceive it as an emergency.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sometimes kids intentionally or unintentionally misuse insulin (insufficient parent supervision is a problem). 
            </li>
            <li>
                Parents and children can become overly reliant on technology and pumps but may not know what to do if something breaks.

            <li>
                Transportation is a significant barrier for patients needing to get to the hospital.
            </li>
            <li>
                Uniformity of resources is lacking, contributing to non-emergency calls perceived as emergencies.

            In developing the design requirements from the research findings, as a team we were struggling to narrow down our focus and scope for the redesign, so we decided to have the experts and users rank which features they would classify as most important.

        <h3><b>Goal:</b></h3>
        <h3>To understand what the users initial ideas (in sketch form) are about the redesign before diving into high fidelity wireframes</h3>
        <h3><b>Rationale</b></h3>
        <h3>Low stakes environment to check if the designs are going in the right direction before completing full wireframes</h3>
        <h3><b>Research Questions</b></h3>
        <h3>
            <li>Is the layout and navigation intuitive, allowing users to complete key tasks without confusion?</li>
            <li>Which elements of the design are most helpful or engaging, and which aspects cause hesitation or frustration?</li>
            <li>How well does the visual hierarchy guide users toward important information or actions?</li>

        <h3><b>Context:</b></h3>
       <h3>
        <li>Physically printedmade copies of all of the frames and had 2 healthcare providers mark up any changes they would make to the frames</li>
        <li>Virtually tested the sketches with 10 healthcare providers, noting any changes</li>
