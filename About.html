      I am a senior at the Milwaukee School of Engineering University (MSOE),
      studying User Experience (UX) with a minor in Psychology. I am interested
      in UX research, looking to discover users wants and needs they did not
      even know they wanted in their products, as well as common pain points
      that they run into routinely. I do this through a variety of different
      methods like persona development, usability testing, surveys, and
      interviewing. I regularly put these skills to practice at my UX researcher
      internship at Johnson Controls as well as in the classroom at MSOE. I also
      work part-time as a Sales Associate at J.Crew Factory, where I enjoy
      implementing my previous training in textiles with new knowledge of user
      experience in a retail environment. Outside of my studies, I am a
      student-athlete playing on the Womens Soccer team at MSOE and I enjoy
      running, biking, and spending time with my pet hedgehog Sammy.
