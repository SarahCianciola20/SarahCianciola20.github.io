          Drivers will be able to use touch and physical controls to navigate
          through this infotainment system to be able to accept/reject phone

          on the A/C, and start a navigation route.
          <br />
          <br />
          This was done by researching existing car infotainment systems to help
          guide our own original design, using Adobe XD.

          <b>

        We created an infotainment system that uses both touch and control with
        a voice command (out of the scope of the design). We combined research
        from both luxury and standard infotainment systems to create a system
        with little or no learning curve.

      <h4>Features of Design:</h4>

      <h3>
        One pattern we used was similar, since we discovered in our foundational
        research that most of our users had iPhones, we designed our
        infotainment system based on an iPhone UI. As many of the icons and apps
        are very similar which relates to the user's mental model for these
        functionalities.
        <br />
        <br />
        We also chose to create our design based on the pattern of color and
        particularly using high contrasting colors because from our foundation
        research we found that many of our users were older and having high
        contrasting colors could help usability. Additionally, our home screen
        follows the pattern of a dashboard since there are many different-sided
        modular sections. This also ties back to the pattern of similarity,
        having different-sized modules resembles the home screen an iPhone user
        might choose to use. Finally, each page has an escape hatch being the
        home icon on the top right corner and in the physical controls, this
        helps the user return to the dashboard home screen at any time.
        <br />
        <br />
        Overall, some design principles we used on the home screen were in
        contrast as described above with the high contrast of black background
        with white text. We also used the design principle of proximity by
        putting apps close together on the left and on the right with all the
        car details and settings. Also, we used alignment, one example is we
        aligned all the apps on the left.

      <h4>Sample of Workflows:</h4>

      <h3>
        For this workflow we knew based on our research, that our audience is
        older, so we wanted to keep their same mental model of controling the
        A/C with physical buttons/controls. But we also made this functionality
        able to be controlled using touch to appeal to our younger audience we
        are more tech-savvy and are used to using touch screens more.

        <b>Summary of Insights</b>
        <br />

        Wanted to know stats about the car, like when they could get their next
        oil change or how many more miles they have until they need to
        <br />
        <br />
        Confused why there are two home buttons (one touch and one control)
        <br />
        <br />
        Confused about the settings section since there are so many drill-downs
        <br />
        <br />
        Make the highlight for controls thicker
      </h3>
      <br />
      <h3>
        <b>Improvements Based on the Insights</b>
        <br />
        We addressed the want to know more about the car stats by adding a
        section with this information below the music section
        <br />
        <br />
        We decided to keep both home buttons because in our original user
        interviews we gathered alot of data that supported the fact that users
        wanted to be able to use both touch and controls to complete a task.
        <br />
        <br />
        If we had more time we would have liked to redesign our settings screens
        to eliminate some of the drill downs.
        <br />
        <br />
        We addressed the highlight for the controls section and made the line
        thicker.

        <b>Notiable Considerations</b>
        <br />
        We tested this prototype on a laptop with 5 users, in would have been
        more ideal if we tested this system while driving in a controled
        enviroment.
        <br />
        <br />

        An improvement we should have done would be testing which features
        should be disabled when driving and which features should be available
        at all times to prevent user errors and for overall safty purposes.

        One challenge we faced was designing controls while using Adobe XD,
        which is a 2D design program. This made the prototype seem really flat
        and hard to tell which parts were touch and which parts were controls.
        This was a problem we noticed when we did our usability tests and
        probably influenced our results.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another challenge we faced was designing for a wide range of users with
        a very broad range of technical knowledge. What was interesting was our
        primary users were old adults who generally are not very tech savvy but
        their older children or young adults in general were our other users who
        might also drive this car, so we had to make sure the car was techy
        enough for them but the older adults were still able to understand how
        to use the car.

        Our car infotainment system had a SUS (System Usability Scale) Usability

        We decreased the number of interactions from 4 to 2 for listening to a
        text message (compared to our KLM testing).

      </section>
      <h3>
        This product taught me personally a lot more than just the UI design.
        One of the first concepts I learned was what Key Level Modeling is and
        how this can help guide the design by highlighting pain points in
        specific areas of improvement. Another skill that I learned was how to
        work in a field like the automotive industry where there are a lot of
        constraints mainly with safety. This is why understanding Key Level
        Modeling was so important because I could have designed a beautiful UI,
        but if the UI has too many interactions or cognitive load, this will not
        only be ineffective for the driver but creating a safety concern for
        others on the road. Finally, I learned how to think about the big
        picture of the experience and beyond just the UI, mainly my team and I
        had to think about all of the interactions with the physical buttons and
        how those would interact with the display, as this was the first time I
        designed an experience that had both touch and control features.
