        Drivers will be able to use touch and physical controls to navigate

        calls, listen to a text message, change the source of the audio, turn on
        the A/C, and start a navigation route. (Although this was mainly a group
        project, these parts were completed individually: Key Level Modeling,

          <ol>

              Changing the source on the audio is extremely challenging,

          synthesized the data and discovered that our current user population
          was mainly non-tech-savvy middle-aged adults which posed an
          interesting challenge for us, which left our potential user population
          to be young, tech-savvy adults that mainly could not afford cars with
          infotainment systems.

          Karen is trying to drop her kids off on their first day of school and
          wants to know what the traffic is like for this drive, so they are not
          late. So, she turns off the music that her kids enjoy listening to and
          instead switches to navigation. Then once she drops the kids off at
          school, she stops the navigation and starts listening to her favorite
          radio station.

        <h4>Using radio/media; Switching from AM to FM radio</h4>
        <h3>
          On her way to her weekly Sunday morning Peloton class, Karen wants to
          switch off her morning news and get some energy with the pop music
          station before she goes into her class, so she switches from the AM
          news to an FM radio station.

          We find Karen in a rush to get from work to her doctor's appointment
          on time, and back to work before her break is over. However, on her
          way to the appointment, she is on the phone with her husband, but then
          her boss calls to check the status of her team's progress report for
          their next deal. She rejects the call from her boss but then uses
          voice commands to hear the message back from her boss.

          After Karen's Peloton class she likes to turn on the climate control
